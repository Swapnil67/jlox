# Notes
- java is statically typed language but it also does some runtime error handling
- Some languages have operator for string concatenation
  - perl(.)
  - lua(..)
  - Smalltalk(,)
  - Haskell(++)
- In java, javascript, python the '+' operator is overloaded to support both adding numbers and concatenating strings.
- Function return values, but procedures cannot.
- There is no place in grammer where both an expression and statement are allowed. The operands of say, '+' are always expressions, never statements. The body of while look is always statement.

# Program
- A program is a list of statements followed by a special "end of file" [EOF] token.

# Side Effects
- State and statements go hand in hand. Since statements, by definition, don't evaluate to a value, they need to  do something else to be useful. That something is called a "side effect"
